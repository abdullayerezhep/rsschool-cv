## Goal:
I am a highly motivated software developer with a strong foundation in front-end technologies and business process automation. My goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer within the next three years, contributing to the development of scalable, high-performance web applications. I am seeking opportunities where I can leverage my problem-solving skills, passion for learning, and hands-on experience to collaborate with innovative teams and tackle challenging projects. By continuously expanding my expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies, I aim to bring meaningful impact to your company's digital products and services.

## About me:
I hold a degree in IT/Programming from the University of Information Technology and Management, where I studied the fundamentals of computer science. I started my career as a BPM Developer, focusing on business process automation and data manipulation. I later completed an intensive one-year bootcamp at Alem, which helped me secure my current position as a Frontend Developer at Doodocs.

Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve developed a passion for building complex web applications and enjoy breaking down challenging problems into manageable tasks. I have honed key skills such as effective communication, problem-solving, and persistence, which I am eager to bring to your team.
